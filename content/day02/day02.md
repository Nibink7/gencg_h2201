# **Day 2 - 06.09.2022**
Today we tried make a computergraphics based on grids and patterns. I tried to make a grid with imperfect lines. The intention here was to make it look like as it was handmade. I achieved the grid with [Linear Interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation).

For this, I had already my own LERP algorithmn, which draws lines with points next to each other, with an variable y value. I modified it to make the lines look imperfect, like lines that are drawn with an human hand.
