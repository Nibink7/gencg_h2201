Todays topic was to make an machine, that draws a picture. I tried to make a **Fourier series**, which combines several wavefunctions into one.

First I made an standard Fourier Series.

Then Made the different sinwwaves move with more varied frequencies.

And added some different sizes.

**Here are several sources for further explaination about the Fourier Series and Fourier transformation.**

- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/)

To be honest, the Series itself looks more interesting to me, than the wavepatterns, which is why I decided, to let the Series itself take the spotlight.
