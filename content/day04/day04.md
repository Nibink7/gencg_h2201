Todays topic was to make an machine, that draws a picture. I tried to make a **Fourier series**, which combines several wavefunctions into one.

With the help of the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eYfj0SgA&t=1421s) I made an standard Fourier Series.

Then Made the different sinwwaves move with more varied frequencies.

And added some different sizes.

To be honest, the Series itself looks more interesting to me, than the wavepatterns, which is why I decided, to let the Series itself take the spotlight.
