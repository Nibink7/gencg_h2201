 Today we got introduced to Generative Computer Graphics. 

### Computing without a Computer
Together we recreated "the Beach" by [Moniker Studio](https://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/the-beach/). We were Three people and each of us had a pen with a different color. 

### Computing with a Computer
I tried to reacreate the [Sol Lewitt Wall Drawing](https://jessicacarnegie.com/sol-lewitt-wall-drawing-118). The drawing contains multiple, randomly placed dots, which are all connectet by straight lines.

Today we had the task to do an unique clock, that should involve some kind of cycle. My idea was to make a globe rotate periodically, in which the time could be told based on it's rotational angle. The Idea was inspired by [**Blender Guru**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YZzHn0iz8U)
To make the globe more earthlike, I applied a [texture](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1rxblwi19i78ieh/AADNsHNRA7SysJ015GkXplewa?dl=0), which was provided by NASA. At first I applied the earth texture on a sphere and after that I tried to make it reflect light, by letting it emit it from another sphere, that should represent the sun. to make it more realistic, I applied a cloud texture ontop the earth texture.
