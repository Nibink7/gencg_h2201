## Day 2 - 05.09.2022
Today we tried make a computergraphics based on grids and patterns. I tried to make a grid with imperfect lines. The intention here was to make it look like as it was handmade. I achieved the grid with Linear Interpolation.

## Day 3 - 06.09.2022
Today we had the task to do an unique clock, that should involve some kind of cycle. My idea was to make a globe rotate periodically, in which the time could be told based on it's rotational angle. 
To make the globe more earthlike, I applied a [texture](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1rxblwi19i78ieh/AADNsHNRA7SysJ015GkXplewa?dl=0), which was provided by NASA. At first I applied the earth texture on a sphere and after that I tried to make it reflect light, by letting it emit it from another sphere, that should represent the sun. to make it more realistic, I applied a cloud texture ontop the earth texture.
